1. Define dictionary course_room with course numbers as keys and lists of room number, instructor, and meeting time as values

Function get_course_details(course_number):
    If course_number is in course_room:
        Retrieve course details from course_room using course_number
        Format and return course details as a string
    Else:
        Return an error message indicating the course number is not available

Function main:
    While True:
        Prompt user to enter a course number or 'exit' to quit
        If user input is 'exit':
            Print "exiting the loop"
            Break the loop
        Call get_course_details with user input and print the returned details

If this script is executed directly:
    Call the main function
